# Computational Testing Enviornment
Includes code for testing ideas related to my PhD studies at the operations research group at Aalborg University.

## Dubins package:
The pip package for dubins does not work, however the following fork works: https://github.com/rdesc/pydubins


## Ideas:
Maybe we could implement an alternative to the neighbourhood level, to decrease the number of adjacent nodes in our graphs, but still keep the benefits?
