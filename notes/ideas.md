# A 
Maybe a bidirectional greedy crossover operator could yield good performance for TOP, while using the SDR tensor to guide the search.

# Entropy in GA

# CEDOPADS
Compare with GRASP for a discretised version of the problem?

# Genetic algorithm
Can the entropy of a population in a GA be used to adabt the mutation rates throughout exectution?

Alternatively is it posible to construct a neural network which addapts the hyperparameters on the fly.
